## Grace An - Portfolio Website
This project is a responsive website of my professional portfolio, which contains a collection of the projects I built as a student in CareerFoundry's Web Development Program.

## Key Features
- A homepage with a short introduction and link(s) to work examples
- An about page with key information about you as an individual, your relevant skills,
and the tools or programming language(s) you use
- A section with your work examplesâ€”either as part of your homepage (e.g., in a grid)
or on a separate work page
